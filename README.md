## Notes

A challenge that I faced was making the card component reset to the "question" side of the card when I went to a new card. Initially, when I flipped a card to the "answer" side of the card and proceeded to the next card, the next card would show the "answer" side instead of resetting to the "question" side. I managed to resolve this issue. Another challenge I faced was selecting the next random card that would appear from the card set. I overcame this challenge by utilizing JavaScript's random function to generate a random number that I would use to select the next card to display.
